Welcome to my repository showcasing various C++ projects developed using the Qt framework. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in C++ programming, object-oriented design, and graphical user interface (GUI) development. Qt has provided me with the ability to create cross-platform applications with robust features.

Projects Included
Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

Notepad
A simple yet functional Notepad application built using Qt and C++. This project demonstrates the use of Qt's widgets and event handling to create a text editor with basic features such as creating, opening, saving files, and editing text. The project showcases my understanding of Qt's signal-slot mechanism, file handling, and GUI development with C++.

Calculator
A functional calculator application built with Qt and C++. This project includes basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), along with memory functions (M+, M-, and M) for storing and recalling values. The user interface is built using Qt's button widgets for numbers and operations, and the logic utilizes Qt's signals and slots for smooth interactions. This project demonstrates my skills in GUI development, event handling, and implementing custom features in C++ with Qt.

Requirements
Before running the projects, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Qt Framework (version X.X or higher)
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
CMake (if required by the project)
To install Qt, you can follow the official guide: Qt Installation Guide.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/https://github.com/Akash-N1406/Qt.git
Navigate into the project directory:
cd qt-cpp-projects
Open the project in Qt Creator or use the Qt command line tools to build and run the project.

How to Run
Open the .pro file in Qt Creator (if using Qt Creator) or build using the appropriate CMake/Make commands.
Execute the application.
